# config file for ansible -- http://ansible.com/
# ==============================================

# This config file provides examples for running
# the OpenShift playbooks with the provided
# inventory scripts. Only global defaults are
# left uncommented

[defaults]
# Add the roles directory to the roles path
roles_path = roles/

# Set the log_path
log_path = /tmp/ansible.log

# Uncomment to use the provided BYO inventory
#hostfile = inventory/byo/hosts

# Uncomment to use the provided GCE dynamic inventory script
#hostfile = inventory/gce/gce.py

# Uncomment to use the provided AWS dynamic inventory script
#hostfile = inventory/aws/ec2.py

# ssh arguments to use
# Leaving off ControlPersist will result in poor performance, so use
# paramiko on older platforms rather than removing it, -C controls compression use
#ssh_args = -C -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s

[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -C -o ControlMaster=no
control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r
pipelining = False


# The base directory for the ControlPath sockets.
# This is the "%(directory)s" in the control_path option
#
# Example:
# control_path_dir = /tmp/.ansible/cp
#control_path_dir = $HOME/.ansible/cp

# The path to use for the ControlPath sockets. This defaults to
# "%(directory)s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r", however on some systems with
# very long hostnames or very long path names (caused by long user names or
# deeply nested home directories) this can exceed the character limit on
# file socket names (108 characters for most platforms). In that case, you
# may wish to shorten the string below.
